# Qiskit Explorations 
The purpose of this repository is to explore some concepts and algorithms of quantum computing using the Python package [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

It is assumed that the user has a basic understanding of quantum computing, so the emphasis will not be on theory but on experimenting with that theory using Qiskit.

To be able to run the examples in this repository, one has to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed (for example via the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/)).

The following Python packages are also required to be installed (globally or inside a virtual environment):

- qiskit
- qiskit_aer
- ipyplot
